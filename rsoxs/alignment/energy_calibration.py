    Runs scans to generate calibration data for M2 and plane grating monochromator (PGM) angle offsets.
    Allows flexibility to scan multiple samples at multiple optics conditions.
    Runs corresponding open-beam scans to allow double-normalization of sample scans such that any signal distortions (e.g., due to upstream optics contamination) would be corrected.

    Number of scans is equal to the number of elements in the polarizations, energies, cffs, diffraction orders, sample_ids, and sample_angles lists.
    All of these lists should have identical lengths.
    Note, cannot use np.full to define the defaults because numpy arrays cannot be evaluated with ast.literal_eval().
    
    Args:
        lines_per_mm_pgm: int
            Lines per mm for the PGM used.
        polarizations: list of float values
            Beam polarizations during each scan.
            Defaults to 90°, such that the sample-frame polarization is always 90° regardless of the sample angle.
        energies: list of float values
            Nominal energies (eV) during each scan.
            Defaults to 291.65 eV, which is used for HOPG.
        cffs: list of float values
            Constant of fixed focus (CFF) values during each scan.
            Defaults to [1.35, 1.4, 1.45, 1.5, 1.55], such that it is centered around 1.45, at which RSoXS operates.
        diffraction_orders: list of int values
            Beam diffraction orders during each scan.
            Defaults to diffraction order of 1, as higher orders have not been properly located yet.
        sample_ids: list of string values
            List of samples to be run during each scan.
            Defaults to HOPG, which has sharp, intense peak at 291.65 eV.
        sample_angles: list of float values
            Angles at which sample is rotated during each scan.
            Defaults to 20° (70° sample bar angle) such that TEY samples get a large beam footprint.
        radius_search_window: float
            Defines the range of PGM angles to scan (+/- radius_search_widow from the initial PGM angle).
            Defaults to 0.8°.
        number_points: int
            Number of points to scan.
            Adjust to more finely locate maxima.
            Defaults to 100.
