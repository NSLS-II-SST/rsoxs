## TODO: update code and reorganize contents from alignment_local.py, alignment.py, and fly_alignment into the files in alignment folder
## TODO: code needs updates to comply with data security.  Main changes would be to have functions not point to db.  Instead, they can take in an up-to-date spreadsheet and any other necessary inputs and run that way.
## TODO: if possible, preserve bsui_local such that code that does not require beamline hardware can be run there.
